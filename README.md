# Hyperskill Flashcards Project

This is a Java learning project from Hyperskill/JetBrains Academy, more details here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/44?goal=7

In this project, I implemented a command line program that allows people to test their knowledge using flashcards. Users can:

* add and remove cards
* import cards from and export results to files
* test themselves
* find out which card they get wrong most often
* reset their stats
